# Temporal Production Features Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for key Temporal production features to evaluate and demonstrate their capabilities.

## 1. Scheduled Workflows (Cron) - Report Generation

### Overview
Implement a scheduled workflow that runs every 5 minutes to generate timestamp reports, demonstrating Temporal's cron scheduling capability.

### Implementation Details
- **Workflow**: `ScheduledReportWorkflow`
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **Function**: Capture current timestamp and store in a report
- **Activity**: `ReportActivity` to handle report generation and storage
- **REST Endpoint**: `/scheduled-report` to start/stop the scheduled workflow

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Cron expressions in Temporal
- Scheduled workflow lifecycle management
- Automatic workflow restart on schedule

## 2. Workflow Queries - Monitoring Capabilities

### Overview
Add query methods to existing workflows to enable runtime inspection without affecting workflow execution.

### Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Workflows**: 
  - `ScheduledReportWorkflow`: Query last report time, report count, next scheduled run
  - `ParentWorkflow`: Query current status, completed steps, child workflow status
- **Query Types**:
  - State queries (current status, progress)
  - Data queries (accumulated results, counters)
  - Metadata queries (execution info, timing)

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Non-blocking workflow state inspection
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Debugging and observability patterns

## 3. Continue-As-New - Long-Running Processes

### Overview
Implement a monitoring workflow that uses continue-as-new to prevent history buildup while maintaining continuous operation.

### Implementation Details
- **Workflow**: `MetricsMonitorWorkflow`
- **Purpose**: Continuously monitor system metrics
- **Reset Trigger**: Every 100 events or 24 hours
- **State Preservation**: Pass accumulated state to new execution
- **Activities**: 
  - `MetricsActivity`: Collect system metrics
  - `AlertActivity`: Send alerts when thresholds exceeded

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- History size management
- State transfer between executions
- Infinite workflow patterns
- Event accumulation and reset strategies

## 4. SAGA Pattern - Distributed Transactions

### Overview
Implement a multi-step business process with compensation logic to handle distributed transaction scenarios. The SAGA pattern manages distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of local transactions, where each transaction has a corresponding compensation (rollback) action.

### Implementation Details
- **Workflow**: `OrderSagaWorkflow`
- **Steps**:
  1. **Payment Processing**: Charge customer payment → Compensation: Refund payment
  2. **Inventory Reservation**: Reserve items from inventory → Compensation: Release inventory
  3. **Shipping Scheduling**: Schedule delivery → Compensation: Cancel shipping
  4. **Notification**: Send order confirmation → Compensation: Send cancellation notice
- **Compensation Logic**:
  - Execute compensations in reverse order on failure
  - Track completed steps for accurate compensation
  - Ensure idempotent operations for safe retries
  - Maintain system consistency throughout
- **Activities**:
  - `PaymentActivity`: Handle payment operations (charge/refund)
  - `InventoryActivity`: Manage inventory (reserve/release)
  - `ShippingActivity`: Coordinate shipping (schedule/cancel)
  - `NotificationActivity`: Send notifications (confirm/cancel)

### Workflow Interface Design
```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface OrderSagaWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    OrderResult processOrder(OrderRequest request);
    
    @QueryMethod
    String getOrderStatus();
    
    @QueryMethod
    List<String> getCompletedSteps();
    
    @QueryMethod
    String getFailureReason();
}
```

### Activity Interface Pattern
Each activity will have forward and compensation methods:
```java
public interface PaymentActivity {
    PaymentResult chargePayment(PaymentRequest request);
    void refundPayment(String transactionId);
}
```

### Failure Scenarios to Test
- Payment succeeds but inventory is out of stock
- Payment and inventory succeed but shipping fails
- Random activity failures to test compensation at each step
- Network timeouts during activity execution
- Partial failures within activities

### REST Endpoint Design
- `POST /order-saga/start` - Start new order processing
- `GET /order-saga/status/{orderId}` - Query order status
- `POST /order-saga/simulate-failure` - Inject failures for testing
- `GET /order-saga/compensation-history/{orderId}` - View compensation actions

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Distributed transaction management without 2PC
- Compensation (rollback) strategies with proper ordering
- Error handling in multi-step processes
- Business process reliability and consistency
- Idempotency in distributed systems
- State tracking for compensation accuracy
- Query support for real-time visibility
- Audit trail of all actions and compensations

## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1**: Scheduled Report Workflow ✅
   - Basic scheduling implementation
   - Report generation activity
   - REST endpoint for management

2. **Phase 2**: Query Methods ✅
   - Add queries to ScheduledReportWorkflow
   - Enhance ParentWorkflow with queries
   - Create monitoring endpoints

3. **Phase 3**: Continue-As-New Pattern ✅
   - Implement MetricsMonitorWorkflow
   - Add reset logic and state transfer
   - Demonstrate long-running capabilities

4. **Phase 4**: SAGA Pattern (Next)
   - Create OrderSagaWorkflow with compensation logic
   - Implement all four activities with forward/compensation methods
   - Add comprehensive error handling and state tracking
   - Create REST endpoints for order management
   - Test multiple failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each activity independently
- Verify workflow logic with mocked activities
- Test query responses

### Integration Tests
- Test scheduled workflow execution
- Verify continue-as-new transitions
- Test SAGA compensation scenarios
- Query accuracy validation

### End-to-End Tests
- Full workflow execution paths
- Failure and recovery scenarios
- Performance under load
- History size validation

## Success Criteria

1. **Scheduled Workflows**: Reports generated every 5 minutes without manual intervention ✅
2. **Queries**: Real-time workflow state accessible without disruption ✅
3. **Continue-As-New**: Workflow runs indefinitely without history overflow ✅
4. **SAGA**: Failed transactions properly compensated with system consistency maintained (Pending)

## Monitoring and Observability

- Implement custom metrics for each workflow type
- Add structured logging for workflow events
- Create dashboard-ready query endpoints
- Document operational procedures

## Production Considerations

- Error handling and retry strategies
- Resource usage optimization
- Deployment and versioning approach
- Operational runbooks for each pattern
